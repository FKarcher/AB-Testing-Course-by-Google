I recently finished the A/B Testing course by Google on Udacity. I highly recommend this course to people who want to learn how A/B testing is done, and to data scientists who are interested in how data science, python and statistics are applied in real-life business scenarios. The course summarized how to run an A/B test into 5 steps:

1. Choose invariant and evalution metrics.
2. Choose significance level (alpha), statistical power (1-beta) and practical significance level (the minimum change we want to observe in order to launch the change).
3. Calculate required sample size.
4. Run the test for control and experiment groups.
5. Analyze the results, calulate confidernce intervals of evaludation metrics, and draw conclusions.

This notebook is a capstone project for this course. The goal of this capstone project is to utlize the skills learned in this course and apply them to a business case using real life data. We want to gain insights about if adding an extra screening step after a student clicks the "start free trial" button will reduce the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they couldn't commit enough hours to the course.

The data analysis was done using Pandas. Feel free to check out my codes in the Jupyter notebook. **https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FKarcher/AB-Testing-Course-by-Google/blob/main/AB%20Testing%20using%20Python.ipynb**.
